# RSS-Database-Backup
Simple PHP script to grab items in a folder and show as RSS Feed



Edit any entires that are in ALL CAPS to suit your setup.

For example, I use this in a folder called /_db_backup/, the script lies inside of this folder and the script has a 36 character randomized file name so that no one simply guesses the feed's address. Directory listing via .htaccess is obviously turned off as well.

You can setup IFTTT like the below screenshot:
